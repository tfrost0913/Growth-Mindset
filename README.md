# Growth-mindset
Growth mindset is something that I believe will greatly benefit me especially since I am the type of person that loses focus easily especially when I run into a roadblock.  Sometimes I don't even realize it when it happens.  Always looking to improve on whatever task it is that I'm working on is very crucial.  Also throughout the years I've found that I've tend to stay focus and not be too hard on myself by tracking my progress daily.  As long as I'm moving, I'm good.

2. I'm not alone.
3. I got it done.
